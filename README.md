## key points that every developer must master 👩‍💻?

There is always things we have to do to be commited to our work and career , for developers its the same but in a more complex way , for example : 

- We have to understand the project and why are we building it becouse misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.

- Simplicity / Complexity ,  try reducing the size of the problem by tering it to smalller problems 

- and many other things like automation , Testing , Code measurement , etc . . . 

- But the most important thing for me is  Self-Development
